# Dynamic Fall Damage
The way fall damage is calculated in the base game is stages, heres a list of those stages.

1. 30 Damage
2. 50 Damage
3. 80 Damage
4. 100 Damage

This mod changes that, and makes fall damage smoothly go from 30 to 100+ (you can also take more than 100 fall damage now).

This mod is recommended to be used alongside Lethal Weight:

This mod was made in a few hours so sorry if there are any bugs.
