# Lethal Weight
You take more fall damage the more you weigh. That's it!

The scale is roughly 100lb is double the fall damage as normal.

This mod will work better when another mod im making releases.

README will be updated when that happens.

This mod was made in one hour so sorry if there are any bugs.s

# Hey, can I use Lethal Weight in (blank)?
**Yes!**

You can do whatever you want with this mod! (as long as it's not paid for)

Include it in modpacks, include it in your mods, just do it!

Just give me credit with a link back to the original mod page, that's all I ask for.
